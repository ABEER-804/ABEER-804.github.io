        <h2>Admission Requirements</h2>
        <p>
            The basic prerequisites to gain admission into universities differ with universities, course type as well as the level of study (undergraduate or postgraduate). However, here are some common admission requirements that universities often consider: <br>
            <b>Educational Background:</b> The introduction highlights three core factors that define a typical contender: Education - contenders are often expected to have a given level of education when applying for a program, whether it is a high school diploma or an undergraduate degree among other specifications. <br>
            <b>Academic Performance:</b> Most universities have set a minimum GPA, which stands for Grade Point Average, that students must achieve before they can be considered for admissions. The GPA requirement for prerequisites may also be modified depending on the intensity of the program of choice. <br>
            <b>Standardized Test Scores:</b> Most universities have set the knowledge of standardized tests such as the SAT or ACT for students seeking to be admitted to an undergraduate program or GRE or GMAT for students seeking to be admitted to postgraduate programs. <br>
            <b>Letters of Recommendation:</b> It may be required for the applicants obtain recommendation letters from teachers, professors, or employers to vouch for the applicantâ€™s academic aptitude, integrity and capability to perform on the program. <br>
            <b>Personal Statement or Essay:</b> Many universities ask for personal statement or personal essays together with their application forms. This integrated essay involves the aspects of writing ability or writing sample, statement of purpose, and background and experience of the applicants in relation to the university they are applying for. <br>
            <b>Interviews:</b> There are some cases when interview for applicants is compulsory and is one of the conditions that has to be fulfilled in order to gain the admission. Possible topics that the applicants might be expected to discuss at the interview include academic interests, the overall career objective, and the selection of the program. <br>
            <b>English Language Proficiency:</b> University admissions requirements for foreign students may also include English language proficiency documented through language proficiency test results such as the TOEFL or the IELTS. <br>
           <p>Admission requirements for universities and programs vary and therefore, any student, who is applying for admission, should always ensure that he or she checks for the requirements for every university of a program of his or her choice. Furthermore, the applicant does not automatically meet any admissions requirement even if the minimum is fulfilled because other factors can also play a role in the decision of the applicant to gain admission or not which include availability of slots in the chosen program and the competition rates of other aspiring students in the same program.</p>
